What is VegaDiscoveriesTech (VDT)?
----------------------------------

VegaDiscoveriesTech (VDT) is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. VDT uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. VDT is based on Bitcoin Core with substantial modifications.
